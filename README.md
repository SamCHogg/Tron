# Tron
Tron for CS118 Robot Maze. This was a created for fun for the bonus challenge.

I believe this only works on Windows because of the weird stuff I did to get colours working.

## How to run

1. Run `maze-environment.jar`
2. Add `Tron.class` to the 'Robot controllers'
3. Read the instructions.
